        OttoDB is a key value database with transactional support. This paper explains the motivations, architecture, and design decisions made while creating OttoDB. OttoDB is heavily influenced by optimistic concurrency control strategies and adopts a similar protocol as Redis \cite{b1}.

    \section{Introduction and Motivation}
    Many web applications utilize databases for storing and retrieving data. As the need for different storage types has increased, multiple types of databases have been created: relational, document, key value stores, and many others. This paper will focus on creating a key value database, OttoDB.
    
    Key value stores usage can range from a form of quick cache storage to a simple mapping of values. Many key-value stores have come up as contending solutions in this space: Redis \cite{b1}, CouchBase \cite{b3}, HBase \cite{b4}, Boltdb \cite{b5}, and many others \cite{b6, b7, b8}. These key-value stores vary in performance, deployment, and storage/operational guarantees (e.g. persistent storage, transaction support). One of the most popular key value stores is the open-source project Redis \cite{b1}. It’s become one of the most performant and popular solutions \cite{b27}. While Redis allows for multi object transactions, they aren’t atomic, so they won’t fully abort if one operation in the grouping errors \cite{b28} OttoDB attempts to solve this problem, by supporting transaction and all ACID database properties. 
    
    In many applications, database operations (e.g. writes, reads) tend to be the bottleneck of an application. Due to this, almost every data storage service allows for concurrent processing of requests. By opening up a computer’s resources to multiple threads, more resources can be utilized. Many problems can be made faster by switching to a multithreaded design. The main point of multi-threaded applications is to maximize speed, but that speed comes at a cost. There are many problems that can occur when operations are run concurrently. Concurrent operations can create data races, where two threads are either writing simultaneously, or reading a value that another thread is in the middle of writing. Concurrency control mechanisms are needed to prevent data races from occurring. This is especially crucial in databases, where the goal is to provide stable storage. With the thought of speed in mind, OttoDB utilizes optimistic concurrency control techniques to improve performance under low levels of contention. 
    
    Writing applications against multi-threaded data storage systems can be difficult. In order to ease those difficulties, many databases offer an abstraction called a transaction. A transaction in a database is an operation or series of operations. Transactions are usually atomic, so their mutations only persistent all together or not at all. They are isolated from the rest of the database, so concurrent transactions don’t conflict with each other. OttoDB provides safe transactions through a serializable snapshot level of isolation, and write-ahead persistent log.
    
    In this paper, I describe the architecture and implementation of OttoDB. I will spend quite a lot of time explaining the optimistic concurrency control methods used to make OttoDB transactionally safe as well as performant. I tell my journey of making my first key value store, and the design decisions that were made in the process. I also compare the performance of OttoDB with Redis, utilizing it’s customizable redis benchmarking tools.
    
    The implementation of OttoDB is in no way revolutionary, but it does utilize techniques that are lesser-known (i.e. Multi version concurrency control, Serializable snapshot isolation). It is highly influenced by the types of systems described in Martin Kleppmann’s book, Designing Data-Intensive Applications \cite{b1}. I based OttoDB on all the optimistic concurrency control strategies explained through the book.
    
    My goal for making OttoDB was to first and foremost learn the ins and outs of databases, and gain a better understanding of how databases work. I was also hoping to create a key value database that utilizes optimistic concurrency control whenever possible. This area of concurrency control was fascinating to learn about, and I’m looking forward to sharing the techniques that are used to make OttoDB faster than if implemented through traditional locking techniques.

    \section{Overview}

    %Overal Architecture Figure%

    OttoDB runs as a tcp server, listening to requests to then perform operations on the underlying data storage layer. When a new transaction begins, it’s given an atomically increasing transaction id, which is used to determine record visibility. Every client is handled by a separate go routine (lightweight-thread), and interacts directly with an in-memory store of key/value records. Storing data in-memory allows for faster reads/writes on the data as compared to if it was solely stored on disk. As commands come in they are written to an append-only log, which acts as persistent storage. On startup/restart, the log is replayed on the store before any requests are handled. OttoDB’s protocol is influenced heavily by that of Redis. OttoDB supports get, set, and delete operations, along with others for transactional control.

    \subsection{Protocol}

    OttoDB supports a similar protocol as Redis \cite{b1}, but with a smaller variability of data stored; OttoDB currently only supports keys and values as strings. The following operations OttoDB supports are shown below.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item BEGIN - Starts a transaction with the client, all future requests are scoped to the transaction.
        \item COMMIT - Lets OttoDB know you’re ready to commit the transaction to the store
        \item GET \textit{key} - Returns the string value of the \textit{key}, if it exists. If not, returns an empty string
        \item SET \textit{key} \textit{value} - Sets \textit{value} to \textit{key} in the database or updates previously set key, returns message ‘OK’
        \item DEL \textit{key} - Deletes a record in the database associated with the provided \textit{key}, returns message ‘OK’ on success
        \item ABORT - Rolls back any changes made by the current transaction and ends the transaction
        \item QUIT - Kills the active TCP connection with the database
    \end{itemize}

    Similar to Redis \cite{b1}, all requests are terminated with an {\textbackslash}r{\textbackslash}n string. 

    \subsection{Multi Version Concurrency Control (MVCC)}

    Multi Version Concurrency Control (MVCC), is a technique used in OttoDB for implementing snapshot isolation. Snapshot isolation allows transactions to run as if they are viewing their own version of the database, snapshotted in time. This allows long running read-only transactions to run without interruption from many writing transactions. The main concept of MVCC is that “readers never block writers, and writers never block readers” \cite[p. 239]{b18}. 

    \subsection{Serializable Snapshot Isolation (SSI)}

    Although MVCC is a performant isolation level, it’s also considered a weak isolation level \cite[p. 261]{b18}. Serializable Snapshot Isolation (SSI) provides full serialization to even weak isolation levels that revolve around the idea of optimistic concurrency control \cite[p. 261]{b18}. It can perform better than true serialized execution and in loads of low contention, better than two-phase commit \cite[p. 265]{b18}. SSI is used by PostreSQL and FoundationDB \cite[p. 261]{b18}. 

    \subsection{Transactional Support}

    The above isolation levels make OttoDB a fully serializable database. In OttoDB transactions: (1) Are performed all together or not at all. (2) Don’t affect other transactions. The second property is handled through an MVCC and SSI implementation. 

    % Storage
    \section{Storage}

    \subsection{LSM-Tree of SSTables for append-only storage}

    The storage layer for OttoDB was inspired by an append-only disk writing approach taken in some databases (LevelDB \cite{b7}, RocksDB \cite{b6}, and Cassandra \cite{b19}). In this approach, data is stored in an in-memory, self-balancing tree. When in-memory storage gets too large, it’s flushed into a Sorted String Table (SSTable) \cite[p. 78]{b18}, shown in Figure X. SSTables hold key value pairs, along with a timestamp in sorted order on disk. Paired with keys in sorted order, there’s a sparse, in-memory, index map, which holds an offset to a few keys in the table \cite[p. 77]{b18}. 

    %Figure X, SSTable Structure

    As the in-memory store keeps getting filled up, it gets flushed to new SSTables. A background process merges tables together with a similar merging algorithm to the merge in merge-sort. Newer timestamps are chosen over older ones, so the data on disk gets compressed. By merging and compacting these appen-only structures, it creates a Log Structured Merge Tree (LSM-Tree), shown in Figure Y \cite[p. 78-79]{b18}. 

    %Figure Y, LSM-Tree compaction 

    This data storage approach allows for fast writes to an in-memory structure, but potentially slow read times; you might need to look many SSTables back to find a key \cite[p. 79]{b18}.

    \subsection{OttoDB’s in memory storage}

    Originally, OttoDB’s in-memory data was stored in a Red Black Tree, to make sure that the tree stayed balanced. Despite the benefits of an always balanced tree, adding concurrency control to the RBTree became difficult. This was because inserting one node could cause any number of tree rotations. This required the entire tree to be locked from other concurrent operations during an insert or delete. Performing a database wide lock on every transaction was not attractive, especially because my goal is to minimize time spent blocking on locks. While researching concurrent RBTree implementations, I found many papers \cite{b20, b21}. These implementations were clever, complex, and couldn’t fit in the scope of my project.

    % Figure Wait-free concurrent Red Black Tree Design. Src [\cite{b20}]

    At the point of implementing concurrency control on the RBTree, I had taken up half of my project development time. I decided to save writing data to SSTables for later, and stick with only an in-memory representation of data, along with a persisted log. Simplifying the storage layer, I changed the RBTree to a  binary tree. This change allowed me to still make the LSM-Tree/SSTable implementation in the future, as well as made concurrent safety much easier to implement.

    % Figure X, Keys stored in tree

    \subsection{OttoDB’s Write-Ahead Log}

    % Figure Z, Format of log

    OttoDB utilizes a write-ahead log, as a form of persistence and recovery. In OttoDB, the log is stored as a protocol buffer. Similar to xml and json, protocol buffers are used as a way to serialize data for either storage or message passing \cite{b22}. On startup, OttoDB checks to see if this log exists. If the log exists, all aborted transactions get filtered out, and only previously committed transactions get replayed on a new binary tree. This functionality provides OttoDB with increased durability, as it can handle being shut down while still keeping store state.

    \section{Transaction Isolation}

    Transactions provide a great guarantee to developers. Imagine a database where transactions don’t have any isolation. You could write a transaction that reads a value that later on gets aborted. You could also overwrite a value that an active transaction just set, completely losing the update of that transaction. Databases without isolation between transactions can cause utter chaos. 
    
    In order to make developers sane, transactions should be isolated. Just like how we need to protect in-memory data structures with locks or semaphores, transactions need to be protected through isolation. Isolation in transactions is a basic guarantee in almost all databases that help developers with deployed code sleep at night.

    \subsection{Read Committed Isolation}

    Read committed isolation provides the most basic of isolation functionalities. The main functionalities are: (1) A transaction can only read values that have been committed, (2) A transaction can only overwrite values that have been committed. These two guarantees prevent dirty reads, and dirty writes. \cite[p. 234]{b18}.

    % Figure X, No dirty Reads Src[\cite[p. 234]{b18}] , User 2 only sees the value of 3 until after user 1 has committed.

    % Figure Y, Example of a dirty write. Src [\cite[p. 236]{b18}]

    Read committed isolation is the default isolation level in PostgreSQL, SQL Server 2012, and MemSQL \cite[p. 236]{b18}. This technique is simple, but has some major performance drawbacks. The main issue with read committed isolation is that transactions hold onto locks of the values the read or write until their transaction commits or aborts \cite[p. 236]{b18}. If a long write-heavy transaction is running, it can prevent smaller read-only transactions from making progress, as they will block until the write-heavy transaction’s locks are freed.

    % Figure Z, Example of read skew Src[\cite[p. 237]{b18}]

    Another downfall of read committed isolation is that it’s susceptible to read skew \cite[p. 237]{b18}. If a transaction were to read a value once, that value gets overwritten by a committing transaction, if the transaction reads that value again it will get a different result. Read skew can affect a database when it’s being backed up, by providing it an inconsistent view of the database \cite[p. 237]{b18}. It can also be tough for analytic queries, as they could return an inconsistent view of the data \cite[p. 237]{b18}. I wanted OttoDB to be as transactionally safe as possible, so a read committed isolation level was not a valid isolation target.

    \subsection{Snapshot Isolation}

    Snapshot isolation provides the same protections that read committed does, and also protects from read skew. The main idea behind snapshot isolation is that a transaction “sees all the data that was committed in the database at the start of the transaction. Even if the data is subsequently changed by another transaction, each transaction sees only the old data from that particular point in time” \cite[p. 238]{b18}. This isolation level is supported in many of the most popular databases \cite[p. 239]{b18}. 
    
    In order to provide this functionality to long running queries, multiple versions of each record are stored. This allows older transactions to read versions of data in their own snapshot while newer transactions can read data that has been committed before them.

    \subsection{OttoDB’s Snapshot Isolation Implementation}

    % ** Figure showing the unique transaction number and idea behind the snapshot (only older committed txn values are present) **

    OttoDB stores multiple versions of a key through a technique called Multi Version Concurrency Control (MVCC). When a transaction is started, its first given a unique transaction-id. This transaction-id is used to determine which versions of data a transaction can view or overwrite. Transactions in MVCC can only view data from committed transactions that came before the transaction began.

    \section{Related Work}
    OttoDB is not alone in its implementations or novel in strategies used to develop a highly concurrent key-value store. OttoDB is heavily inspired by other database systems at the storage, concurrency control, transaction, and protocol levels. 

    At the storage level, OttoDB utilizes the same concepts of many databases (RocksDB \cite{b6}, LevelDB \cite{b7}, HBase \cite{b4}) by keeping an in-memory self-balancing tree which read/write requests go to, and a LSM Tree of SSTables to organize data on disk. This algorithm was originally made popular in Google’s Bigtable paper \cite[p. 78]{b18}, and has since been implemented in many systems. 

    At the concurrency control and transaction level, OttoDB is the most similar to CockroachDB \cite{b8}, in the fact that both utilize optimistic concurrency control through MVCC. Due to CockroachDB’s distributed nature, their implementation is much different and requires more coordination. Despite this difference, CockroachDB’s documentation has been tremendously helpful in learning about MVCC and supporting transactions on top of it. 

	As mentioned earlier, OttoDB's protocol is directly inspired from that of Redis \cite{b1}. OttoDB’s protocol is much simpler than that of Redis however; responses are simple strings, and not prefixed with an identifier. OttoDB only supports operations on key value strings, while Redis allows for a wider range of data types: Lists, Hashes, Sets, and many more \cite{b11}.


    % For the proposal, what experiments do you plan to conduct and why? What
    % question is each experiment designed to answer? What do you hope to learn from each experiment?
    % What equipment, software, or tools do you need? What tests will you conduct conditionally? (For
    % example, if we learn X from experiment 1 then we must do A else we’ll do B.) What problems do you
    % expect?
    % For the first draft and final project report, update this section to describe the status of your experimentation.
    % Did you have to make any changes to your experimental strategy? If so, why?
    \section{Experimental Set-up}
    OttoDB will be tested by comparing read-heavy and write-heavy workloads to other popular key-value databases (Redis \cite{b1}, BoltDB \cite{b5}, HBase \cite{b4}). I’ll be testing high loads of sequential and concurrent requests to the databases, and measuring response times. Along with single-op requests, I’ll also test transactions with systems that provide transactional support. Along with measuring response times, I’ll also measure the correctness of the data. I’ll be performing these tests by writing clients in Go that spawn sequential/concurrent requests, and utilize Go’s benchmarking tools as experiment output. From these experiments, I’m hoping to better understand the type of application where OttoDB is a good fit. 

    % For the proposal, what sorts of results do you expect to observe? Obviously, you do not
    % know what the results are in advance, but you should know the format of those results. For example, if
    % you are comparing two systems, you would expect to be able to say things like, “System A outperforms
    % system B in these circumstances.” Naturally, after you have completed the experimentation, you should
    % also be able to explain why.
    \section{Results}
    I fully expect Redis \cite{b1} and other key value stores to outperform OttoDB, due to their maturity and highly skilled creators. The only area I’m expecting to see OttoDB outperform some current applications is in workloads with heavy random writes (due to the LSM Tree / SSTable storage layer). Seeing the differences between current systems and my own, I’ll try to argue that the stricter transactional capabilities of OttoDB and on-disk persistence are worth the performance drop, and can meet a specific application need.

    % \subsection{\LaTeX-Specific Advice}
    
    % Please use ``soft'' (e.g., \verb|\eqref{Eq}|) cross references instead
    % of ``hard'' references (e.g., \verb|(1)|). That will make it possible
    % to combine sections, add equations, or change the order of figures or
    % citations without having to go through the file line by line.
    
    % Please don't use the \verb|{eqnarray}| equation environment. Use
    % \verb|{align}| or \verb|{IEEEeqnarray}| instead. The \verb|{eqnarray}|
    % environment leaves unsightly spaces around relation symbols.
    
    % Please note that the \verb|{subequations}| environment in {\LaTeX}
    % will increment the main equation counter even when there are no
    % equation numbers displayed. If you forget that, you might write an
    % article in which the equation numbers skip from (17) to (20), causing
    % the copy editors to wonder if you've discovered a new method of
    % counting.
    
    % {\BibTeX} does not work by magic. It doesn't get the bibliographic
    % data from thin air but from .bib files. If you use {\BibTeX} to produce a
    % bibliography you must send the .bib files. 
    
    % {\LaTeX} can't read your mind. If you assign the same label to a
    % subsubsection and a table, you might find that Table I has been cross
    % referenced as Table IV-B3. 
    
    % {\LaTeX} does not have precognitive abilities. If you put a
    % \verb|\label| command before the command that updates the counter it's
    % supposed to be using, the label will pick up the last counter to be
    % cross referenced instead. In particular, a \verb|\label| command
    % should not go before the caption of a figure or a table.
    
    % Do not use \verb|\nonumber| inside the \verb|{array}| environment. It
    % will not stop equation numbers inside \verb|{array}| (there won't be
    % any anyway) and it might stop a wanted equation number in the
    % surrounding equation.
    
    % \subsection{Some Common Mistakes}\label{SCM}
    % \begin{itemize}
    % \item The word ``data'' is plural, not singular.
    % \item The subscript for the permeability of vacuum $\mu_{0}$, and other common scientific constants, is zero with subscript formatting, not a lowercase letter ``o''.
    % \item In American English, commas, semicolons, periods, question and exclamation marks are located within quotation marks only when a complete thought or name is cited, such as a title or full quotation. When quotation marks are used, instead of a bold or italic typeface, to highlight a word or phrase, punctuation should appear outside of the quotation marks. A parenthetical phrase or statement at the end of a sentence is punctuated outside of the closing parenthesis (like this). (A parenthetical sentence is punctuated within the parentheses.)
    % \item A graph within a graph is an ``inset'', not an ``insert''. The word alternatively is preferred to the word ``alternately'' (unless you really mean something that alternates).
    % \item Do not use the word ``essentially'' to mean ``approximately'' or ``effectively''.
    % \item In your paper title, if the words ``that uses'' can accurately replace the word ``using'', capitalize the ``u''; if not, keep using lower-cased.
    % \item Be aware of the different meanings of the homophones ``affect'' and ``effect'', ``complement'' and ``compliment'', ``discreet'' and ``discrete'', ``principal'' and ``principle''.
    % \item Do not confuse ``imply'' and ``infer''.
    % \item The prefix ``non'' is not a word; it should be joined to the word it modifies, usually without a hyphen.
    % \item There is no period after the ``et'' in the Latin abbreviation ``et al.''.
    % \item The abbreviation ``i.e.'' means ``that is'', and the abbreviation ``e.g.'' means ``for example''.
    % \end{itemize}
    % An excellent style manual for science writers is \cite{b7}.
    
    % \subsection{Authors and Affiliations}
    % \textbf{The class file is designed for, but not limited to, six authors.} A 
    % minimum of one author is required for all conference articles. Author names 
    % should be listed starting from left to right and then moving down to the 
    % next line. This is the author sequence that will be used in future citations 
    % and by indexing services. Names should not be listed in columns nor group by 
    % affiliation. Please keep your affiliations as succinct as possible (for 
    % example, do not differentiate among departments of the same organization).
    
    % \subsection{Identify the Headings}
    % Headings, or heads, are organizational devices that guide the reader through 
    % your paper. There are two types: component heads and text heads.
    
    % Component heads identify the different components of your paper and are not 
    % topically subordinate to each other. Examples include Acknowledgments and 
    % References and, for these, the correct style to use is ``Heading 5''. Use 
    % ``figure caption'' for your Figure captions, and ``table head'' for your 
    % table title. Run-in heads, such as ``Abstract'', will require you to apply a 
    % style (in this case, italic) in addition to the style provided by the drop 
    % down menu to differentiate the head from the text.
    
    % Text heads organize the topics on a relational, hierarchical basis. For 
    % example, the paper title is the primary text head because all subsequent 
    % material relates and elaborates on this one topic. If there are two or more 
    % sub-topics, the next level head (uppercase Roman numerals) should be used 
    % and, conversely, if there are not at least two sub-topics, then no subheads 
    % should be introduced.
    
    % \subsection{Figures and Tables}
    % \paragraph{Positioning Figures and Tables} Place figures and tables at the top and 
    % bottom of columns. Avoid placing them in the middle of columns. Large 
    % figures and tables may span across both columns. Figure captions should be 
    % below the figures; table heads should appear above the tables. Insert 
    % figures and tables after they are cited in the text. Use the abbreviation 
    % ``Fig.~\ref{fig}'', even at the beginning of a sentence.
    
    % \begin{table}[htbp]
    % \caption{Table Type Styles}
    % \begin{center}
    % \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
    % \hline
    % \textbf{Table}&\multicolumn{3}{|c|}{\textbf{Table Column Head}} \\
    % \cline{2-4} 
    % \textbf{Head} & \textbf{\textit{Table column subhead}}& \textbf{\textit{Subhead}}& \textbf{\textit{Subhead}} \\
    % \hline
    % copy& More table copy$^{\mathrm{a}}$& &  \\
    % \hline
    % \multicolumn{4}{l}{$^{\mathrm{a}}$Sample of a Table footnote.}
    % \end{tabular}
    % \label{tab1}
    % \end{center}
    % \end{table}
    
    % \begin{figure}[htbp]
    % %\centerline{\includegraphics{fig1.png}}
    % \caption{Example of a figure caption.}
    % \label{fig}
    % \end{figure}
    
    % Figure Labels: Use 8 point Times New Roman for Figure labels. Use words 
    % rather than symbols or abbreviations when writing Figure axis labels to 
    % avoid confusing the reader. As an example, write the quantity 
    % ``Magnetization'', or ``Magnetization, M'', not just ``M''. If including 
    % units in the label, present them within parentheses. Do not label axes only 
    % with units. In the example, write ``Magnetization (A/m)'' or ``Magnetization 
    % \{A[m(1)]\}'', not just ``A/m''. Do not label axes with a ratio of 
    % quantities and units. For example, write ``Temperature (K)'', not 
    % ``Temperature/K''.
    
    % \section*{Acknowledgment}
    
    % The preferred spelling of the word ``acknowledgment'' in America is without 
    % an ``e'' after the ``g''. Avoid the stilted expression ``one of us (R. B. 
    % G.) thanks $\ldots$''. Instead, try ``R. B. G. thanks$\ldots$''. Put sponsor 
    % acknowledgments in the unnumbered footnote on the first page.
    
    % \section*{References}
    
    % Please number citations consecutively within brackets \cite{b1}. The 
    % sentence punctuation follows the bracket \cite{b2}. Refer simply to the reference 
    % number, as in \cite{b3}---do not use ``Ref. \cite{b3}'' or ``reference \cite{b3}'' except at 
    % the beginning of a sentence: ``Reference \cite{b3} was the first $\ldots$''
    
    % Number footnotes separately in superscripts. Place the actual footnote at 
    % the bottom of the column in which it was cited. Do not put footnotes in the 
    % abstract or reference list. Use letters for table footnotes.
    
    % Unless there are six authors or more give all authors' names; do not use 
    % ``et al.''. Papers that have not been published, even if they have been 
    % submitted for publication, should be cited as ``unpublished'' \cite{b4}. Papers 
    % that have been accepted for publication should be cited as ``in press'' \cite{b5}. 
    % Capitalize only the first word in a paper title, except for proper nouns and 
    % element symbols.
    
    % For papers published in translation journals, please give the English 
    % citation first, followed by the original foreign-language citation \cite{b6}.
